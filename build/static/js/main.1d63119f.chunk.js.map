The lender of the loan decides a rate of interest\r\n      that the borrower must pay on the money borrowed along with the principal\r\n      amount borrowed. A person can avail loans of various types to meet the\r\n      funding gaps of his or her requirement. However, it is very important to\r\n      know what types of loans are available for meeting a particular\r\n      requirement in order to maximise the benefits and minimise the impact in\r\n      terms of interest pay-out and meeting other loan requirements.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h4>Types of Loans</h4>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Various types of loans are available in India. However, they can be\r\n      broadly classified into following types:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Loans based on purpose</li>\r\n      <li>Secured or unsecured loans</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h5>\r\n      <strong>Loans based on purpose</strong>\r\n    </h5>\r\n    <h5>Education loans</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Demand for education loan demand has emerged from the growing aspiration\r\n      for higher education among Indian students from premium institute in India\r\n      and abroad. Education loans taken by students for various types of courses\r\n      including professional degree courses, full time and part time degree\r\n      courses and vocational courses. The loan covers the basic fees of the\r\n      course along with other expenses like accommodation, travel exam fee. In\r\n      general, student is the main applicant and his parent, siblings or spouse\r\n      is the co-applicant as the case may be. The loan is to be repaid by the\r\n      students after completion of the study / course. However, such education\r\n      loan generally has a feature of moratorium period where student has the\r\n      option of paying the EMI after completion of 12 months of course or 6\r\n      months after the student start working whichever is earlier.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Vehicle loan</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A vehicle loan is given to the borrower to buy a two-wheeler, four-wheeler\r\n      or a LCV, HCV. Loans are given to buy a new vehicle or a used vehicle as\r\n      well. The loan tenure and interest rates depend upon the credit history of\r\n      the borrower and the loan amount. In general, these loans have tenure of 5\r\n      to 7 years.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>\r\n      <strong>Secured loans</strong>\r\n    </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Loans against which a collateral is required are called secured loans.\r\n      Various types of secured loans are as under:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Home loans</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A home loan simply means a sum of money borrowed from a financial\r\n      institution or bank to purchase a house. Home loans consist of an\r\n      adjustable or fixed interest rate and payment terms. The buyer has to pay\r\n      10-25% of the total property value and loan amount disbursed depends on\r\n      your credit history, current income and its stability and liabilities.\r\n      Home loans can be taken by a single person or jointly by two or more\r\n      persons. People generally take a home loan for either buying a house/flat\r\n      or a plot of land for construction of a house, or renovation, extension\r\n      and repairs to the existing house. The property is mortgaged to the lender\r\n      as a security till the repayment of the loan. The bank or financial\r\n      institution will hold the title or deed to the property till the loan has\r\n      been paid back with the interest due for it. The interest rates for home\r\n      loans can be fixed or floating, or partly fixed and or partly floating,\r\n      suiting the needs of the borrower. The foremost benefit of a home loan is\r\n      the income tax deduction you can claim on the interest and principal\r\n      repayments. You can claim up to Rs.1.5 lakh on principal repayments under\r\n      section 80C, up to Rs.2 lakh on interest repayments under section 24B of\r\n      the Income Tax Act. You can always prepay your home loan to shed the\r\n      financial burden before time. More importantly, you do not have to pay a\r\n      penalty on pre-payment after the Reserve Bank of India in 2013 directed\r\n      banks to waive charges for loans taken on floating rate of interest.\r\n      However, banks still charge a penalty on transfer if you have taken a home\r\n      loan at a fixed rate of interest. Once you have your home or a piece of\r\n      land you can take following loans for your existing home.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Home Construction Loan</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      This is the right home loan type if you already have a plot of land and\r\n      you need financing to construct a house in that land.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Home Extension Loan</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      This loan is taken when you want to extend the house with another room or\r\n      another floor to accommodate the growing family. Home extension loan\r\n      provides financing for this purpose.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Home Improvement Loan</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A home improvement loan provides financing for renovating or repairing the\r\n      house if there’s any fault in the existing system, such as painting the\r\n      house’s interior or exterior, plumbing, upgrading the electrical system,\r\n      waterproofing the ceiling, and more.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Home Loan Balance Transfer</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The current home loan interest rate may be overwhelming, or you may not be\r\n      happy with your current lender’s service; you can transfer the home loan’s\r\n      outstanding balance to a different lender who offers a lower interest rate\r\n      and better service. Upon transfer, you can even check out the\r\n      possibilities of a top-up loan on your existing one.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Composite Home Loan</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      This type of home loan provides financing for purchasing the plot of land\r\n      where you would like to construct a house and for the construction, both\r\n      within a single loan.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Loans against property</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Loan against property is a loan which you avail by keeping your commercial\r\n      or residential property as a collateral to the lender. The security in\r\n      this kind of loan is the property owned by the person applying for the\r\n      loan. The value of your property decides the amount of potential loan you\r\n      will be sanctioned.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>You can avail this loan against following types of property:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Self-owned piece of land</li>\r\n      <li>Self-owned commercial property</li>\r\n      <li>Self-owned but rented commercial property</li>\r\n      <li>Self-owned residential property</li>\r\n      <li>Self-owned and self-occupied residential property</li>\r\n      <li>Self - owned but rented residential property</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n      One can avail loan against a property for numerous reasons.It could be\r\n      anything from education of your children, foreign trip, wedding, business\r\n      expansion or working capital requirement, purchasing a new property,\r\n      renovating existing property, loan consolidation etc. Value of your\r\n      property is not the only criteria for banks to decide whether you are\r\n      eligible for a loan.They would also look into your current income,\r\n      savings, employment status, liabilities and other aspects before coming to\r\n      disbursement. It must be noted that as a standard practice, lending\r\n      institutions generally sanction loans of around 65% of the value of your\r\n      property.The tenure offered in such loan is 15 years subject to age norms.\r\n      The rate of interest in this loan is lower than personal loans making it\r\n      one of the cheapest and pocket-friendly loans coming second only to home\r\n      loans.The loan tenure of 15 years makes the EMI more comfortable and there\r\n      is also the option of liquidating your money in the case of any big\r\n      expense.The only drawback with such a loan is that the bank may take\r\n      possession of your property if you fail to repay the loan amount, however,\r\n      a careful and planned approach should you see through quite smoothly.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Loan against insurance policy</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Loan against insurance policy is becoming popular these days since the\r\n      interest rates offered are lower than the personal loan and the value of\r\n      the policy does not change with the market as in the case of loans against\r\n      gold or securities. Loans are provided considering the surrender value of\r\n      permanent or whole life insurance and not against term insurance as it\r\n      does not have any cash value on expiry.In general, if you have paid three\r\n      premiums for at least three years and on time for a non-term insurance you\r\n      are eligible to avail such a loan.Since you are borrowing from yourself in\r\n      this case you generally don’t undergo an intense scrutiny or stringent\r\n      approval process though some lenders may check your creditworthiness. Such\r\n      loans are provided by life insurance companies like LIC as well as banks.\r\n      The interest rate charged for such loans depends upon the value of premium\r\n      and number of premiums that have been paid by the borrower.The higher the\r\n      premium value and more is the premium paid the lower would be the interest\r\n      rates.In general interest rates applied by insurance companies is slightly\r\n      lower than those by banks. The loan is to be paid within the terms of the\r\n      policy.The borrower has the option of paying both principal and interest\r\n      or only interest then the principal amount due will be deducted from the\r\n      claim amount at the time of settlement. Person taking loan against the\r\n      insurance policy should keep in mind that taking huge loan against the\r\n      insurance policy may deprive the nominees of the benefit of the insurance\r\n      policy.In case of death of the policyholder before loan is repaid the\r\n      nominees would get balance claim amount after the unpaid loan due are\r\n      deducted from the claim amount.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Loan against Securities (shares, mutual funds, bonds)</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You may need instant liquidity to meet personal exigency or to seize an\r\n      attractive business opportunity.One of the ways to do this is by taking a\r\n      Loan against Securities by which you can surely meet your immediate\r\n      funding needs without having to sell your investments.

Income earned\r\n      through these investments and the capital appreciation realized is shared\r\n      by its unit holders in proportion to the number of units owned by them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A mutual fund is the most suitable investment scope for common people as\r\n      it offers an opportunity to invest in a diversified, professionally\r\n      managed basket of securities at a relatively lower cost. Investors who may\r\n      not want to invest directly in financial markets may instead get exposure\r\n      to the same securities through a mutual fund. Similarly, investors can\r\n      diversify their portfolio holdings even with small amounts, by investing\r\n      in gold and real estate through mutual funds. An investor may choose to\r\n      invest through a mutual fund to be able to use the services of the fund\r\n      manager who will make the investment decisions relating to selection of\r\n      securities, timing of investments, reviewing and rebalancing the portfolio\r\n      periodically and executing the operational decisions related to the\r\n      portfolio.These services are provided to the investor by charging a fee.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Units of mutual fund</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Just as an investor’s investments in equity of a company is represented in\r\n      number of shares, or investments in debt is represented in number of bonds\r\n      or debentures, each investor’s holding in a mutual fund is represented in\r\n      terms of units that is derived from the amount invested.Each unit\r\n      represents one share of the fund. The units are first offered to the\r\n      investors at the time the scheme is launched through a new fund\r\n      offer(NFO).Subsequently, depending upon the structure of the scheme, the\r\n      fund may or may not issue fresh units to investors.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Net Assets</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The assets of a mutual fund scheme are the current value of the portfolio\r\n      of securities held by it.There may be some current assets such as cash and\r\n      receivables.Together they form the total assets of the scheme. From this,\r\n      the fees and expenses related to managing the fund such as fund manager’s\r\n      fees, charges paid to constituents, regulatory expenses on advertisements\r\n      and such are deducted to arrive at the net assets of the scheme. This\r\n      belongs to the investors in the fund who have been allotted units and no\r\n      other entity has a claim to it. The Net assets of a scheme will go up\r\n      whenever investors buy additional units in the scheme and bring in funds,\r\n      or when the value of the investments held in the portfolio goes up, or\r\n      when the securities held in the portfolio earns income such as dividends\r\n      from shares or interest on bonds held. Similarly, the net assets of the\r\n      scheme will go down if investors take out their investments from the\r\n      scheme by redeeming their units or if the securities held in the portfolio\r\n      fall in value or when expenses related to the scheme are accounted for.\r\n      The net assets of the scheme are therefore not a fixed value but keep\r\n      changing with a change in any of the above factor.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Net Asset Value(NAV)</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The net asset per unit of a scheme is calculated as Net assets / Number of\r\n      outstanding units of the scheme.This is the Net asset value(NAV).The NAV\r\n      of the scheme will change with every change in the Net Assets of the\r\n      scheme.All investor transactions are conducted at the current NAV of the\r\n      scheme. The value of a mutual fund investor’s investment is calculated\r\n      using the NAV.If an investor has invested 100 units in the scheme at\r\n      Rs.100, the value of the investment is Rs.10000.When the NAV goes up to\r\n      Rs.120, the value of the investment also goes up to Rs.12000 and when the\r\n      NAV goes down to Rs.111 the value of the investment comes down to Rs.1110\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Mark to Market</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The current value of the portfolio forms the base of the net assets of the\r\n      scheme and therefore the NAV.It means that if the portfolio was to be\r\n      liquidated, then this would be the value that would be realised and\r\n      distributed to the investors.Therefore, the portfolio has to reflect the\r\n      current market price of the securities held.This process of valuing the\r\n      portfolio on a daily basis at current value is called marking to\r\n      market.The price is taken from the market where the security is traded.If\r\n      the security is not traded or the price available is stale, then SEBI has\r\n      laid down the method for valuing such securities.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\nconst structureOfMF = (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <h3>Structure of typical Mutual fund: </h3>\r\n    <h5>Sponsor </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Sponsor is the person who either alone or in association with another\r\n      corporate body, establishes a mutual fund.

Mutual fund schemes can be structured as\r\n      open-ended or closed-end schemes.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Open-Ended Schemes </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Open-ended schemes are mutual funds that can issue and redeem their shares\r\n      at any time. An open-ended scheme allows investors to invest in additional\r\n      units and redeem investment continuously at current NAV{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Open-ended funds do not have restriction on the amount of shares the fund\r\n      will issue. They offer units for sale without specifying any duration for\r\n      redemption.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      If demand is high enough, the fund will continue to issue shares, no\r\n      matter how many investors are there.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Open-ended funds also buy back shares when investors wish to sell. </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      One of the key features of open-end schemes is the liquidity that these\r\n      funds offer to investors.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Closed-End Schemes </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A closed-end scheme is for a fixed period or tenor. It offers units to\r\n      investors only during the new fund offer (NFO). The scheme is closed for\r\n      transactions with investors after this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The units allotted are redeemed by the fund at the prevalent NAV when the\r\n      term is over and the fund ceases to exist after this. In the interim, if\r\n      investors want to exit their investment, they can do so by selling the\r\n      units to other investors on a stock exchange where they are mandatorily\r\n      listed.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The unit capital of a closed end fund does not change over the life of the\r\n      scheme since transactions between investors on the stock exchange does not\r\n      affect the fund{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The fund is then structured, listed and traded like a stock, on a stock\r\n      exchange. The price per share is determined by the market and is usually\r\n      different from the underlying value or net asset value (NAV) per share of\r\n      the investments held by the fund.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The price is said to be at a discount or premium to the NAV when it is\r\n      below or above the NAV, respectively. A premium might be due to the\r\n      market's confidence in the investment manager’s ability to produce\r\n      above-market returns. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A discount might reflect the charges to be deducted from the fund in\r\n      future by the fund managers. Some close-ended funds give an option of\r\n      selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at\r\n      NAV related prices.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      SEBI regulations stipulate that at least one of the two exit routes is\r\n      provided to the investor, that is, either repurchase facility or through\r\n      listing on stock exchanges. These mutual funds schemes disclose NAV\r\n      generally on weekly basis.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Interval Schemes </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Interval funds are a variant of closed end funds which become open-ended\r\n      during specified periods.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      During this period investors can purchase and redeem units like in an\r\n      open-ended fund.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The specified transaction periods are for a minimum period of two days and\r\n      there must be a minimum gap of 15 days between two transaction periods.\r\n      Like closed-ended funds, these funds have to be listed on a stock\r\n      exchange.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Types of open-ended mutual funds </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      SEBI has defined the process of categorizing open-end mutual fund products\r\n      broadly as equity schemes, debt schemes, hybrid schemes, solution-oriented\r\n      schemes and other schemes.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>1. Growth or Equity-Oriented Schemes </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The aim of growth funds is to provide capital appreciation over medium to\r\n      long- term. These schemes normally invest a major part of their portfolio\r\n      in equities and have comparatively high risks.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      They provide different options to the investors like dividend option,\r\n      capital appreciation, etc. and investors may choose one depending on their\r\n      preferences. The mutual funds also allow the investors to change the\r\n      options at a later date.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Growth schemes are good for investors having a long-term outlook seeking\r\n      appreciation over a period of time.

PPF is one of the safest investment options and provides among the highest returns in terms of interest as well as tax benefits and is therefore is one of the most popular investment options particularly for risk averse investors.\r\n                        This option also provides the best benefit of compounding wherein the interest is given on the interest accrued on deposited your amount during the year. Since this plan is mandated by the government, it is backed up with gu\r\n                        aranteed returns to protect the financial needs of the investors. Invested funds in the PPF account are not market-linked</p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5> Where you can open your PPF account?</h5>\r\n                    <p> PPF is a 15-year deposit account that can be opened with a designated bank or a post office. It can also be opened online with a few banks.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>Who can open a PPF account?</h5>\r\n                    <p>An individual can open a PPF account at any age. A person can hold only one PPF account in their name except an account in the name of a minor child to whom he or she is a guardian.\r\n                        HUFs and NRIs are not allowed to open PPF accounts.\r\n                        If a resident subsequently becomes an NRI during the prescribed term, he/she may continue to subscribe to the fund till its maturity on a non-repatriation basis.

Interest is cumulated and not paid out. Interest rates currently payable on such accounts stands at 7.1%, and is subject to quarterly updates at the discretion of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>When my PPF account matures and can I make withdrawal in between?\r\n                    </h5>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The account matures after expiry of 15 years from the end of financial year in which the account was opened.\r\n                        One withdrawal in a financial year is permissible from seventh financial year.

factory buildings &\r\n        machinery may break down or may be destroyed leading to loss of\r\n        output.The events themselves cannot be avoided.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The consequences of the loss can either be borne by the person to whom\r\n        the benefits accrue(risk retention) or they can be transferred to\r\n        another(risk transfer).\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Insurance enables risk transfer from the beneficiary(insured) to the\r\n        insurance company(insurer), which undertakes to indemnify the insured\r\n        for the financial loss suffered.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In return, the insured pays a periodic fee, called premium, to the\r\n        insurer to receive this protection.To be insurable, the event being\r\n        insured against, such as death, accident or fire must result in a\r\n        financial loss which can be quantified and insured against.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The premium payable will depend upon this expected loss and the\r\n        probability of the event occurring during the period of contract.For\r\n        example, the premium payable on a health policy for an individual whose\r\n        parents have a history of ill - health that are considered genetic, such\r\n        as ailment of heart, cancer or diabetes, is much higher than that for an\r\n        individual coming from healthy stock.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This is because the chance that the insurance company will be required\r\n        to pay medical expenses in the first case is much higher than what it is\r\n        in the second case.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In the absence of insurance, the loss arising out of the event has to be\r\n        borne by the person who would have otherwise enjoyed the benefit from\r\n        the asset.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>How does it work ?</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Any individual or company can seek insurance from an insurance company,\r\n        but the decision to provide insurance is at the discretion of the\r\n        insurance company.The insurance company will evaluate the claim\r\n        application to make a decision.Generally, insurance companies refuse to\r\n        provide insurance to high - risk applicants.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once insurer company approves the application it enters into a legal\r\n        contract or agreement with insured for the insurance, which is called\r\n        the insurance policy.The insurance policy has details about the\r\n        conditions and circumstances under which the insurance company will pay\r\n        out the insurance amount to either the insured person or the nominees.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Generally, the premium for a big insurance cover is much lesser in terms\r\n        of money paid.The insurance company takes this risk of providing a high\r\n        cover for a small premium because very few insured people actually end\r\n        up claiming the insurance.This is why you get insurance for a big amount\r\n        at a low price.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5>Tax benefits on Insurance </h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The income tax benefits that you can avail from life insurance and\r\n        medical insurance policy:{\" \"}\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"square\" }}>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Life insurance premium of up to ₹1.5 lakh can be claimed as a\r\n          tax-saving deduction under Section 80C of Income Tax Act{\" \"}\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Medical insurance premium of up to ₹25,000 for yourself and your\r\n          family and ₹25,000 for your parents can be claimed as a tax-saving\r\n          deduction under Section 80D under Income Tax Act{\" \"}\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  const typesOfInsurance = (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h3>Types of Insurance</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Insurance in India can be broadly divided into life insurance and non -\r\n        life insurance.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Life Insurance</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As the name suggests, life insurance is insurance on your life.You buy\r\n        life insurance to make sure your dependents are financially secured in\r\n        the event of your untimely demise.Life insurance is particularly\r\n        important if you are the sole breadwinner for your family or if your\r\n        family is heavily reliant on your income.

Many credit cards attract customers by offering incentives such as airline miles, hotel room rentals, gift certificates to major retailers, and cash back on purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <h4>Types of Credit Cards:</h4>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Many retail establishments come up with branded versions of credit cards, with the store's name emblazoned on the card, to generate customer loyalty.

Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.\r\n                        A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\r\n                        Blockchains, which are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data, are an essential component of many cryptocurrencies\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual \"tokens,\" which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system.\r\n                        \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h3>Types of CryptoCurrency</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch.\r\n                        Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto.\" As of March 2021, there were over 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $927 billion.2\r\n                        Some of the competing cryptocurrencies spawned by Bitcoin’s success, known as \"altcoins,\" include Litecoin, Peercoin, and Namecoin, as well as Ethereum, Cardano, and EOS. Today, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence is around $1.5 trillion—Bitcoin currently represents more than 60% of the total value.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h3>Advantages of Cryptocurrency</h3>\r\n                    <p>Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are instead secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.\r\n                        In modern cryptocurrency systems, a user's \"wallet,\" or account address, has a public key, while the private key is known only to the owner and is used to sign transactions. Fund transfers are completed with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.\r\n                        Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology, which is used to keep an online ledger of all the transactions that have ever been conducted, thus providing a data structure for this ledger that is quite secure and is shared and agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, or computer maintaining a copy of the ledger. Every new block generated must be verified by each node before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h3>Disadvantages of cryptocurrency</h3>\r\n                    <p>The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion.\r\n                        However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistle-blowers or activists living under repressive governments. Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others.\r\n                        Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business online, since the forensic analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped authorities arrest and prosecute criminals. More privacy-oriented coins do exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult to trace.\r\n                        As cryptocurrencies are virtual and are not stored on a central database, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by the loss or destruction of a hard drive if a backup copy of the private key does not exist.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Since market prices for cryptocurrencies are based on supply and demand, the rate at which a cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another currency can fluctuate widely, since the design of many cryptocurrencies ensures a high degree of scarcity.\r\n                        Bitcoin has experienced some rapid surges and collapses in value, climbing above  $60,000 per Bitcoin in April 2021 before dropping to around $35,000 in May 2021 Cryptocurrencies are thus considered by some economists to be a short-lived fad or speculative bubble.\r\n                        There is concern that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not rooted in any material goods. Some research, however, has identified that the cost of producing a Bitcoin, which requires an increasingly large amount of energy, is directly related to its market price.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button variant=\"secondary\" onClick={handleClose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n// import { Card, CardDeck, CardGroup } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\n\r\nexport default function RealEstate() {\r\n    const history = useHistory();\r\n\r\n    const closeModal = e => {\r\n        e.stopPropagation();\r\n        history.goBack();\r\n    };\r\n    const [show, setShow] = useState(true);\r\n\r\n    const handleClose = () => {\r\n        setShow(false);\r\n        history.goBack();\r\n    }\r\n    // const handleShow = () => setShow(true);\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"RealEstate\" id=\"#RealEstate\">\r\n            {/* <Button variant=\"primary\" onClick={handleShow}>\r\n                Loans\r\n            </Button> */}\r\n            <Modal className=\"modalBackdrop\"\r\n                show={show}\r\n                onHide={handleClose}\r\n                // onExiting={'./Learn'}\r\n                animation={true}\r\n                onClick={closeModal}\r\n                size=\"lg\"\r\n\r\n            >\r\n\r\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\r\n                    <Modal.Title>Real Estate</Modal.Title>\r\n                </Modal.Header>\r\n\r\n                <Modal.Body>\r\n                    <h3> What is Real Estate?</h3>\r\n                    <p>Real Estate is one of the key investment option for investors in India. Investment in real sector is done keeping in view the appreciation in the property prices over the years and regular income like rental income. Real estate investment comprises of investment in residential properties and commercial properties for an individual investor.</p>\r\n                    <p>Growth of investment in real sector in India was fuelled by reforms in the sector bringing higher transparency in the entire process.

Generally, investment for longer duration fetch better returns.Investment in real estate when a particular area is seeing a lot of investment opportunities is likely to fetch better returns than investing in areas which where growth has already peaked.Therefore, selection of right location of property, whether residential or commercial, is another important criterion affecting returns for such an asset.</p>\r\n                    <p>Also, the rental income for properties given on rent depends upon the importance of the locality in which property is located.Property located in areas with good infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity, good access to water, electricity medical and other facilities is likely to give investors good rental income as well as higher appreciation in price for sale in future.However, investor may have to pay a premium while buying such a property over buying properties in areas lacking in such facilities.So, investor needs to do a lot of research and due diligence before he or she finalise the property for purchase.</p>\r\n                    <p>In order to boost the growth in the sector government has created the financial resources to fund residential and commercial projects and lot of incentives are provided to the industry time to time.Investors, in particular those buying residential property, are provided tax benefits under Income Tax Act to promote purchase of residential properties.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>However, purchase of properties not only have cost attached with the property itself but an investor has to incur many other expenses also at the time of purchase of property.This includes registration charges, stamp duty charges, GST etc.Then there are regular maintenance charges which an investor has to pay especially of the property is part of a housing society or commercial complex.</p>\r\n                    <p>However, investment in property do not have risk which an investor can have while investing in stocks.</p>\r\n                    <p>Gains made in real estate are subject to capital gain tax with certain relaxation/exemption available on reinvestment of gains.</p>\r\n                    <p>Overall real estate investment is good investment option for investor having a lot of surplus money or a very stable income source and for investor who is looking for diversification in his or her investment portfolio.</p>\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button variant=\"secondary\" onClick={handleClose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n// import { Card, CardDeck, CardGroup } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\n\r\nexport default function Gold() {\r\n    const history = useHistory();\r\n\r\n    const closeModal = e => {\r\n        e.stopPropagation();\r\n        history.goBack();\r\n    };\r\n    const [show, setShow] = useState(true);\r\n\r\n    const handleClose = () => {\r\n        setShow(false);\r\n        history.goBack();\r\n    }\r\n    // const handleShow = () => setShow(true);\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"Gold\" id=\"#Gold\">\r\n            {/* <Button variant=\"primary\" onClick={handleShow}>\r\n                Loans\r\n            </Button> */}\r\n            <Modal className=\"modalBackdrop\"\r\n                show={show}\r\n                onHide={handleClose}\r\n                // onExiting={'./Learn'}\r\n                animation={true}\r\n                onClick={closeModal}\r\n                size=\"lg\"\r\n            >\r\n\r\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\r\n                    <Modal.Title>Gold</Modal.Title>\r\n                </Modal.Header>\r\n\r\n                <Modal.Body>\r\n                    <h3>Traditional use of gold in India</h3>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>In India, gold is seen as an asset that is suitable for long term wealth creation.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>It is also used as a collateral for loans and is therefore seen as an asset to fall back on when in need for funds.</li>\r\n                        <li>Indians are among the largest retail buyers of gold in the world.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Traditional allocation to gold among even middle- class households may be high due to the purchase of jewellery. </li>\r\n                        <li>However, Gold jewels have limited investment value due to their high making costs, no income generating power, and limited sale to realize the gain due to the emotional attachment to jewels.

Reforms in the share market and technology revolution has created even bigger interest among people to invest in shares.\r\n                        Given the importance of shares in the investment world it is important to understand this investment process from the very beginning.</p>\r\n                    <p>Any company after its incorporation and bringing its product or services into the market need capital on regular basis to run the operation of the company and grow. Every company has various sources available to it to fund its capital requirement. Initially, it does it through internal accrual including cash from operations, capital infusion by the promoters and other associates.\r\n                        As the requirement for additional funds go up, it may be necessary to source funds from a wider group of investors. One of the ways to raise capital from outside investors is by offering a small portion of share in the ownership of the company to the large number of people in exchange of certain amount. They do that by the way of Initial Public Offer or what we generally call IPO.\r\n                        Once you apply and get allotment of shares through the IPO you become a small investor in the company that is you share the ownership of the company with all other investors. Now once the company is listed on stock exchange through IPO the shares bought by investors are tradable on secondary market where you can buy more shares or sell your existing holding. In simple terms since a share is a document certifying your ownership in a company, you can sell it to someone for a price.\r\n                        The number of shares held by you determines the percentage of holding you have in the company. So, if a company is worth Rs.10 crore and you hold shares worth Rs.10 lakh, then you are a 1% partner in the company. Shares are also known by other names like securities or stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>Similarly, for companies who are already listed on the stock exchanges like NSE or BSE you can buy their shares you can buy their shares from the secondary market. Lets know more about it.</p>\r\n                    <h2>How to buy or sell a share? Understanding the securities market.</h2>\r\n                    <p>The market in which shares or securities are issued, purchased by investors and subsequently transferred among investors is called the securities market.\r\n                        The securities market has two interdependent and inseparable segments, viz., the primary market and the secondary market. The primary market, also called the new issue market, is where issuers or the company raise capital by issuing securities to investors. This is where IPO are launched by the issuers and shares are issued by them to the public at a pre-determined share price.\r\n                        The secondary market, also called the stock exchange, facilitates trade in already-issued securities, thereby enabling investors to exit from an investment or to accumulate more, if it meets their expectations. So, once you get shares from primary market through and IPO you can trade in those shares in the secondary market or what we call the stock exchanges.\r\n                        The risk and rights represented in a securities investment is transferred from one investor (seller) to another (buyer) in the secondary markets. The primary market creates financial assets and the secondary market makes them marketable.</p>\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button variant=\"secondary\" onClick={handleClose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\n// Imported from Headless UI\r\nimport { Disclosure } from '@headlessui/react'\r\nimport { FaChevronUp } from 'react-icons/fa'\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function Accordian() {\r\n    const [readMore, setReadMore] = useState(false);\r\n    const extraContent = <div>\r\n\r\n        <Disclosure as=\"div\" className=\"tw-mt-2\">\r\n            {({ open }) => (\r\n                <>\r\n                    {/* Unopened Display Text */}\r\n                    <Disclosure.Button className=\"tw-h-22 tw-bg-white tw-items-center tw-flex tw-justify-between tw-w-full tw-px-4 tw-py-2 tw-text-xl md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-medium tw-text-left tw-text-black tw-font-semibold tw-rounded-lg hover:tw-bg-nishblue-100 focus:tw-outline-none focus-visible:tw-ring focus-visible:tw-ring-nishblue-200 focus-visible:tw-ring-opacity-75\">\r\n                        <span>Is there a minimum deposit amount or tenor for fixed deposit?</span>\r\n                        <FaChevronUp\r\n                            className={`${open ?

<h3>Alternative Investment</h3>\r\n                    <p>An alternative investment is a financial asset that does not fall into one of the conventional investment categories. Conventional categories include stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments include private equity or venture capital, hedge funds, managed futures, art and antiques, commodities, and derivatives contracts. Real estate is also often classified as an alternative investment</p>\r\n                    <p>One of the most dynamic asset classes, alternatives cover a wide range of investments with unique characteristics. Many alternatives are becoming increasingly accessible to retail, or individual, investors—making knowing about them increasingly important for all types of investors and industry professionals.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Key characteristics</h3>\r\n                    <p>These types of investments can vary wildly in their accessibility and structure, but they share a few key characteristics:</p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>They're illiquid, meaning they can’t be easily sold or otherwise converted to cash\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>They have a low correlation to standard asset classes, meaning they don’t necessarily move in the same direction as other assets when market conditions change</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>While alternative investments share these key traits, they're also a diverse asset class.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <h2>Types of Alternative Investments</h2>\r\n                    <h3>Private Equity</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Private equity is a broad category that refers to capital investment made into private companies, or those not listed on a public exchange, such as the NSE or BSE. There are several subsets of private equity, including:\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Venture capital, which focuses on startup and early-stage ventures\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Growth capital, which helps more mature companies expand or restructure\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Buyouts, when a company or one of its divisions is purchased outright\r\n                        </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>An important part of private equity is the relationship between the investing firm and the company receiving capital. Private equity companies often provide more than capital to the firms they invest in; they also provide benefits like industry expertise, talent sourcing assistance, and mentorship to founders.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Private Debt</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Private debt refers to investments that are not financed by banks (i.e., a bank loan) or traded on an open market. The “private” part of the term is important—it refers to the investment instrument itself, rather than the borrower of the debt, as both public and private companies can borrow via private debt.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Private debt is leveraged when companies need additional capital to grow their businesses. The companies that issue the capital are called private debt funds, and they typically make money in two ways: through interest payments and the repayment of the initial loan.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Hedge Funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Hedge funds are investment funds that trade relatively liquid assets and employ various investing strategies with the goal of earning a high return on their investment. Hedge fund managers can specialize in a variety of skills to execute their strategies, such as long-short equity, market neutral, volatility arbitrage, and quantitative strategies.</p>\r\n                    <p>Hedge funds are exclusive, available only to institutional investors, such as endowments, pension funds, and mutual funds, and high-net-worth individuals.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Real Estate</h3>\r\n                    <p>There are many types of real assets. For example, land, timberland, and farmland are all real assets, as is intellectual property like artwork. But real estate is the most common type and the world’s biggest asset class.</p>\r\n                    <p>In addition to its size, real estate is an interesting category because it has characteristics similar to bonds—because property owners receive current cash flow from tenants paying rent—and equity, because the goal is to increase the long-term value of the asset, which is called capital appreciation.</p>\r\n                    <p>Like with other real assets, valuation is a challenge in real estate investing.Real estate valuation methods include income capitalization, discounted cash flow, and sales comparable, with each having both benefits and shortcomings.To become a successful real estate investor, it’s crucial to develop strong valuation skills and understand when and how to use various methods.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Commodities</h3>\r\n                    <p>Commodities are also real assets and mostly natural resources, such as agricultural products, oil, natural gas, and precious and industrial metals. Commodities are considered a hedge against inflation, as they're not sensitive to public equity markets. Additionally, the value of commodities rises and falls with supply and demand—higher demand for commodities results in higher prices and, therefore, investor profit.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Collectibles</h3>\r\n                    <p>Collectibles include a wide range of items, from rare wines to vintage cars to baseball cards. Investing in collectibles means purchasing and maintaining physical items with the hope the value of the assets will appreciate over time.</p>\r\n                    <p>These investments may sound more fun and interesting than other types, but can be risky due to the high costs of acquisition, a lack of dividends or other income until they're sold, and potential destruction of the assets if not stored or cared for properly. The key skill required in collectibles investment is experience; you have to be a true expert to expect any return on your investment.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Structured Products</h3>\r\n                    <p>Structured products usually involve fixed income markets—those that pay investors dividend payments like government or corporate bonds—and derivatives, or securities whose value comes from an underlying asset or group of assets like stocks, bonds, or market indices. Examples of structured products include credit default swaps (CDS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO).</p>\r\n                    <p>Structured products can be complex and sometimes risky investment products, but offer investors a customized product mix to meet their individual needs. They're most commonly created by investment banks and offered to hedge funds, organizations, or retail investors.</p>\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button variant=\"secondary\" onClick={handleClose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\n// Imported from Headless UI\r\nimport { Disclosure } from '@headlessui/react'\r\nimport { FaChevronUp } from 'react-icons/fa'\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function Accordian() {\r\n    const [readMore, setReadMore] = useState(false);\r\n    const extraContent = <div>\r\n\r\n        <Disclosure as=\"div\" className=\"tw-mt-2\">\r\n            {({ open }) => (\r\n                <>\r\n                    {/* Unopened Display Text */}\r\n                    <Disclosure.Button className=\"tw-h-22 tw-bg-white tw-items-center tw-flex tw-justify-between tw-w-full tw-px-4 tw-py-2 tw-text-xl md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-medium tw-text-left tw-text-black tw-font-semibold tw-rounded-lg hover:tw-bg-nishblue-100 focus:tw-outline-none focus-visible:tw-ring focus-visible:tw-ring-nishblue-200 focus-visible:tw-ring-opacity-75\">\r\n                        <span>Is there a minimum deposit amount or tenor for fixed deposit?</span>\r\n                        <FaChevronUp\r\n                            className={`${open ?

However, a Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP) is a great investment tool for investors looking for stable monthly savings options. One can deposit a fixed amount regularly to create a corpus over time.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            By setting aside an amount each month in SDP. you can build your savings in a disciplined manner, over time. You can save with small monthly deposits, choosing options that suit you best. SDP offers two variants - Monthly Maturity Scheme and Single Maturity Scheme.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            With the Monthly Maturity Scheme, the tenor you choose gets applied to all the deposits you invest in. The maturity date for each deposit is different, as your deposits mature as per the chosen tenor.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            On the other hand, with the Single Maturity Scheme, you can receive maturity proceeds of all your deposits on a single day. The tenor of each deposit placed after the first deposit will gradually reduce, so all your deposits mature on a single date.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            **Conditions apply\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    const linkName = readMore ?

We\r\n      make investments in various assets class based on our research and\r\n      analysis and also based on advice that we take from a friend, family\r\n      member or a financial advisor.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The investment can be made on any type of asset such as mutual fund,\r\n      equity, gold, government bond, real estate, fixed deposit, insurance etc.\r\n      It is important that an you know where you are putting our money, what is\r\n      the process involved and what are the risks involved and how realistic are\r\n      your return expectations from these investments.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>What I need to do before making an investment? </h5>\r\n    <div className=\"womenSpecialImg\">\r\n      <img\r\n        src=\"thingsToKnow.jpg\"\r\n        alt=\"Things to know before you start investing\"\r\n      />\r\n    </div>\r\n    <p>\r\n      There are a few things that you need to know or have before you make any\r\n      kind of investment It can be either some documents or information.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Starting with, you may need documents like Pan Card, Bank Account Details,\r\n      Aadhaar Card, and address proof. Depending upon the type of investment\r\n      that you are making you may also be asked to provide documents like bank\r\n      statement, salary sips, investment and liabilities details, credit score\r\n      etc. Keeping these documents ready will be really handy at the time of\r\n      making the investment.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Nowadays most of the investment that you make can be done online. So, you\r\n      may be required to upload soft copies of documents in most of the cases.\r\n      Keep them handy too! Also, make yourself aware about the online process\r\n      fully so that you do not make any error while filling the details.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>What can I invest in? </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When you have money to make some investments you must know where you want\r\n      to put that money. Let’s talk about the common types of investments here.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Equity </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Equity, stocks or shares are issued by companies to raise money from the\r\n      public through an IPO (Initial Public Offer). The shares of such companies\r\n      are then traded in the secondary markets which are also called stock\r\n      exchanges like Sensex and NSE. Investors can either buy shares through an\r\n      IPO or by buying from stock exchanges. This is one of the most popular\r\n      investment options due to possibilities of high returns. However, keep in\r\n      mind that with high return comes high risk also.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Bonds </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Bonds are highly secure debt instruments that enable an entity to raise\r\n      funds and fulfil its capital requirements. It is a category of debt that\r\n      borrower’s avail from individual investors for a specified tenure. <br />\r\n      Organisations, including companies, governments, municipalities and other\r\n      entities, issue bonds for investors in primary markets. The corpus thus\r\n      collected is used to fund business operations and infrastructural\r\n      development by companies and governments alike. Investors purchase bonds\r\n      at face value or principal, which is returned at the end of a fixed\r\n      tenure. Issuers extend a percentage of the principal amount as periodical\r\n      interest at fixed or adjustable rates.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Real Estate </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You could buy a house, a commercial property or a small piece of land.\r\n      Investing in real estate is a one of the most preferred investment asset\r\n      class in India. Although, it could take a good amount of time as\r\n      investment in real estates are not possible to liquidate in a short\r\n      period.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Fixed Deposit </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      A bank fixed deposit (FD) is also called a term or time deposit, as it is\r\n      a deposit account with a bank for a fixed period of time. It entitles the\r\n      investor to predetermined interest payments and return of the deposited\r\n      sum on maturity.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Gold </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Investment in gold has the potential to beat inflation over a long period.\r\n      It is a safe haven when economic growth is slow and when traditional asset\r\n      classes such as equity and debt are underperforming. As an investment, one\r\n      can purchase it as coins including the Indian Gold Coins available at\r\n      designated branches of MMTC, bars, jewellery, or through mutual funds\r\n      known as gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) or gold funds and the gold\r\n      bonds and gold deposit scheme.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Public Provident Fund (PPF) </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      PPF is one of the safest investment options and provides among the highest\r\n      returns in terms of interest as well as tax benefits and is therefore one\r\n      of the most popular investment options particularly for risk averse\r\n      investors. This option also provides the best benefit of compounding\r\n      wherein the interest is given on the interest accrued on deposited your\r\n      amount during the year{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Things which can impact your financial health while you invest </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Honestly, investments are a great way to earn money but along the gains\r\n      comes risks. One should know about the risk which comes along with these\r\n      types of investments at all times or they might end up in losses.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      One of the common reasons why many investors bear a heavy amount of risk\r\n      is because they invest majority of their money in a single asset class\r\n      like real estate or stocks. This not only lead to huge loss of capital it\r\n      but severely dent investor confidence.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      So, what else you need apart from money when you are ready to invest. Yes,\r\n      you need proper knowledge and analysis of the asset that you plan to\r\n      invest. Many a times people get overconfident and too excited seeing a big\r\n      gain in a particular investment opportunity. It is not a bad thing but it\r\n      often leads them to invest based on their gut feeling and not based on\r\n      facts and figures. Such actions can at times wipe entire capital of the\r\n      investor.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Not to forget, some people lose their patience when returns from their\r\n      investment are not as per the expectations. Let me tell you this, if you\r\n      have done good analysis of the asset you have invested, you need to be\r\n      patient. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you want them to be but\r\n      eventually you will make money.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>How to be confident while investing? </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Start with investing time first. Spend a proper time learning about the\r\n      type of investment you want to be connected to. Take up a course.\r\n      Research. Learn to analyse the market.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      In case you have a busy schedule, contact a financial advisor. An expert\r\n      who can advise you on what type of investments you should be making. It is\r\n      always a great idea to talk to someone with experience.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Build your network. Connect with your friends or family who have a\r\n      financial background or deal with any type of investments. Ask about their\r\n      experience. Talk about your research and knowledge so far.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Gather information about more than one type of investment asset class.\r\n      Diversification is great way to manage your risk and reward.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Trust yourself. Trust your gut feeling. It is not easy putting your money\r\n      out there knowing that there is always a risk. But with risk comes great\r\n      success. Just know that among other risks, no self- belief is the biggest\r\n      one.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Finally, even after taking enough precautions the returns on the\r\n      investment may not be in line with your expectations because a lot many\r\n      factors are beyond our control in this globalised world. So, keep an eye\r\n      on what happening around you and make suitable changes in your investment\r\n      portfolio time to time.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\nconst whyNeed = (\r\n  <div>\r\n    <h3>Why you need a financial plan for a better future? </h3>\r\n    <em>By Bhumika Khandelwal </em>\r\n    <br /><br />\r\n    <div className=\"womenSpecialImg\">\r\n      <img\r\n        src=\"whyNeed.jpg\"\r\n        alt=\"Why you need a financial plan for a better future?\"\r\n      />\r\n    </div>\r\n    <h5>\r\n      Warren Buffett said, “Do not save what is left after spending; instead\r\n      spend what is left after saving.”{\" \"}\r\n    </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Managing personal finance can be quite confusing.

In this situation, a break is a sort of temporary\r\n      solution any woman will come with. Others look for a break when they start\r\n      a family or taking care of their small kids becomes a priority. A few want\r\n      to travel the whole world. So, if you too have taken a break from work,\r\n      then let me tell you, you are not alone. Around 4 to 5% of women every\r\n      year have to take a career break and it’s okay! The world doesn’t end here\r\n      and you have a long way to go.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      But then you want to get back to work sooner or later and continue your\r\n      professional journey. Though, in today’s competitive and demanding world\r\n      getting back to work may not be that easy, taking care of a few things can\r\n      really help. So, without further delay, let’s go over some tips to help\r\n      you get started.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>It’s never too late </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Don’t worry about the duration you took or the things you left. You can\r\n      always start fresh and you can always pick up where you left off. Take all\r\n      the time you need before you start the process of getting back out there.\r\n      Just remember that you are not alone in this and that it is really never\r\n      too late to be who you really want to be.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Make up your mind </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You took the break for a reason. So before you get back to work, ensure\r\n      that you really want to and are ready for it. Sometimes, we tend to look\r\n      for work because we have nothing to do or we simply want to do something\r\n      different. If you just want to try something different, find a hobby.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When a person misses her job or wants to get back to their normal life and\r\n      is excited about it, that is when they are fully ready to go back to their\r\n      work life. Importantly, understand if there is a skill gap for the job\r\n      that you are looking for. If yes, it is better to acquire those skills\r\n      before you start your job hunt. So be honest with yourself about this.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h5>Keep your options open </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      There is too much which happens when you decide to start working again.\r\n      There are job applications to fill, interviews to prepare, impressions to\r\n      be good at and a lot. Now, since you are looking for another job, make\r\n      sure to fill more than just one or two forms. It is important that you\r\n      have a backup option or other opportunities when your application for your\r\n      dream job gets rejected. Sometimes we don’t always get what we think is\r\n      best for us.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Reach out to your connections </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Working on your previous job must have helped you build a network. Use it.\r\n      Connect with your friends, colleagues, mentors and ask them if they know\r\n      any opening or possibility of job for you. In many cases, asking help from\r\n      the known ones has been proved effective. Even try reaching out to your\r\n      past employers if you had a good experience working with them. Joining a\r\n      team or a company that you know can be quite helpful.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Don’t rush into anything </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      With sending out many applications, you will receive various offers. Wait\r\n      for the right one. Don’t hop into the first job offer you receive. If you\r\n      think that the job position is not something where you want to be at, then\r\n      take your time. Wait for other companies to respond. There are a lot of\r\n      options out there. Grabbing the very first opportunity just because it’s\r\n      available immediately will again bring you back to the career break\r\n      circle. This time, make it right!{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Be ready for what’s coming </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When called for an interview, don’t freak out. It is true that it’s been a\r\n      long time since you had to interview but honestly it doesn’t have to be\r\n      that much of a big deal. Go through the job profile that you have applied\r\n      for and prepare accordingly. During the interview just address the answers\r\n      confidently. Present yourself neatly and acknowledge everything you say.\r\n      For better interview preparation you can do this too:{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Watch some helpful youtube videos </li>\r\n      <li>Revise general questions which get asked </li>\r\n      <li>Find out about yourself such as what you do in your free time </li>\r\n      <li>Your work behaviour </li>\r\n      <li>Your strengths </li>\r\n      <li>Your weaknesses </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h5>Mention your career break as an advantage </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Don’t be ashamed or worry about the break you took. You did it because it\r\n      seemed necessary right? So, embrace it. Talk about what you did. Whether\r\n      you conducted some research work or explored a certain skill. Talk about\r\n      your work or understanding which you gained about the certain job position\r\n      during your career break. Don’t worry about you getting hired, as I said\r\n      before there will be plenty of opportunities, just make sure you are\r\n      confident and happy about the break you took. After all, there is no wrong\r\n      in having a little spare time and space for yourself, is there?{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h5>Enjoy that one last day before getting back to normal </h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You finally have the job you want and it is finally time to get back to\r\n      work, but there is still one day left. Don’t use the whole day to prepare\r\n      for the first day at your new job. Take a break for that one last day\r\n      before that same routine starts again. Who knows when you will get such an\r\n      opportunity again, right? It’s a known fact that life is a race and you\r\n      have to be as fast as you can. This last day is your ticket to enjoy the\r\n      slowness before you have to gear up again.{\" \"}\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      When it comes to choosing your career path ahead, it involves a lot of\r\n      decisions. Take your time and explore every opportunity you have. Then\r\n      make your decision wisely. Make sure not to rush or panic about losing any\r\n      position. We have faith in you. You are definitely going to make it.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\nexport default function MoreWomenSpecial() {\r\n  const [modalShow, setModalShow] = React.useState(false);\r\n  const [showData,

In this situation, a break is a sort of temporary solution any woman will come with. Others look for a break when they start a family or taking care of their small kids becomes a priority. A few want to travel the whole world. So, if you too have taken a break from work, then let me tell you, you are not alone. Around 4 to 5% of women every year have to take a career break and it’s okay! The world doesn’t end here and you have a long way to go.  </p>\r\n                    <p>But then you want to get back to work sooner or later and continue your professional journey. Though, in today’s competitive and demanding world getting back to work may not be that easy, taking care of a few things can really help.  So, without further delay, let’s go over some tips to help you get started. </p>\r\n                    <h5>It’s never too late </h5>\r\n                    <p>Don’t worry about the duration you took or the things you left. You can always start fresh and you can always pick up where you left off. Take all the time you need before you start the process of getting back out there. Just remember that you are not alone in this and that it is really never too late to be who you really want to be. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Make up your mind </h5>\r\n                    <p>You took the break for a reason. So before you get back to work, ensure that you really want to and are ready for it. Sometimes, we tend to look for work because we have nothing to do or we simply want to do something different. If you just want to try something different, find a hobby.</p>\r\n                    <p>When a person misses her job or wants to get back to their normal life and is excited about it, that is when they are fully ready to go back to their work life. Importantly, understand if there is a skill gap for the job that you are looking for. If yes, it is better to acquire those skills before you start your job hunt. So be honest with yourself about this. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Keep your options open </h5>\r\n                    <p>There is too much which happens when you decide to start working again. There are job applications to fill, interviews to prepare, impressions to be good at and a lot. Now, since you are looking for another job, make sure to fill more than just one or two forms. It is important that you have a backup option or other opportunities when your application for your dream job gets rejected. Sometimes we don’t always get what we think is best for us. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Reach out to your connections </h5>\r\n                    <p>Working on your previous job must have helped you build a network. Use it. Connect with your friends, colleagues, mentors and ask them if they know any opening or possibility of job for you. In many cases, asking help from the known ones has been proved effective. Even try reaching out to your past employers if you had a good experience working with them. Joining a team or a company that you know can be quite helpful. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Don’t rush into anything </h5>\r\n                    <p>With sending out many applications, you will receive various offers. Wait for the right one. Don’t hop into the first job offer you receive. If you think that the job position is not something where you want to be at, then take your time. Wait for other companies to respond. There are a lot of options out there. Grabbing the very first opportunity just because it’s available immediately will again bring you back to the career break circle. This time, make it right! </p>\r\n                    <h5>Be ready for what’s coming </h5>\r\n                    <p>When called for an interview, don’t freak out. It is true that it’s been a long time since you had to interview but honestly it doesn’t have to be that much of a big deal. Go through the job profile that you have applied for and prepare accordingly. During the interview just address the answers confidently. Present yourself neatly and acknowledge everything you say. For better interview preparation you can do this too:  </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Watch some helpful youtube videos </li>\r\n                        <li>Revise general questions which get asked </li>\r\n                        <li>Find out about yourself such as what you do in your free time </li>\r\n                        <li>Your work behaviour </li>\r\n                        <li>Your strengths </li>\r\n                        <li>Your weaknesses </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <h5>Mention your career break as an advantage </h5>\r\n                    <p>Don’t be ashamed or worry about the break you took. You did it because it seemed necessary right? So, embrace it. Talk about what you did. Whether you conducted some research work or explored a certain skill. Talk about your work or understanding which you gained about the certain job position during your career break. Don’t worry about you getting hired, as I said before there will be plenty of opportunities, just make sure you are confident and happy about the break you took. After all, there is no wrong in having a little spare time and space for yourself, is there?\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h5>Enjoy that one last day before getting back to normal </h5>\r\n                    <p>You finally have the job you want and it is finally time to get back to work, but there is still one day left. Don’t use the whole day to prepare for the first day at your new job. Take a break for that one last day before that same routine starts again. Who knows when you will get such an opportunity again, right? It’s a known fact that life is a race and you have to be as fast as you can. This last day is your ticket to enjoy the slowness before you have to gear up again. </p>\r\n                    <p>When it comes to choosing your career path ahead, it involves a lot of decisions. Take your time and explore every opportunity you have. Then make your decision wisely. Make sure not to rush or panic about losing any position. We have faith in you. You are definitely going to make it. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button onClick={handleclose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tips\r\n","import React, { useState } from 'react'\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction MoneyLessons() {\r\n\r\n    const [show, setShow] = useState(true)\r\n    const history = useHistory()\r\n    function handleclose() {\r\n        setShow(false)\r\n        history.goBack(\"/WomenSpecialHome\")\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n\r\n            <Modal\r\n                className=\"modalBackdrop\"\r\n                show={show}\r\n                onHide={handleclose}\r\n                size=\"lg\"\r\n            >\r\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\r\n                    <Modal.Title>Money lessons every woman should know  </Modal.Title>\r\n                </Modal.Header>\r\n                <Modal.Body>\r\n                    <p>By Bhumika Khandelwal </p>\r\n                    <video className=\"w-100\" style={{ height: \"20rem\" }} src=\"Money_lessons_every_woman_should_learn_from_(1).mp4\" controls />\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        In a perfect world, nobody needs to go to work and worry about savings and make vows to spend less. Unfortunately, the world we live in isn't so perfect and money problems are everywhere. Some of us are tired of our expense bills and others are still working on their saving plans. With every problem comes an experience and with every experience comes a lesson.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Let's discuss some money lessons we could use while spending and saving both.

Well, we have something else for you in the store: </p>\r\n                    <h5>Using too much of your credit card </h5>\r\n                    <p>Credit cards in our generation are one of the easiest solutions to our month- end problems when the salary hasn't been credited yet and the flash sale at that store is important. But what you forget is your budget. Using a credit card simply means taking a loan for your luxury which can never be an ideal solution for your problems. Set a monthly expense limit for all your things including clothes, makeup, food, rent, etc. This way you will be able to avoid your credit card loans when not necessary</p>\r\n                    <h5>Spending money without research </h5>\r\n                    <p>Many times, we see something attractive and decide to purchase it. It could be a pair of jeans, some antique or overpriced cereal. Spending money on things you need is correct but spending on things without knowing their actual worth and their durability can lead you to spend more in the end. This leads to over expense which doesn't seem right for your monthly plan, does it?</p>\r\n                    <p>Always know your products before buying them. Research about the product, select from many options available and then make the right choice. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Pay attention to your funds </h5>\r\n                    <p>Make the habit of keeping minimum cash with you. With so much rush in today's era, losing money has become a common thing. It could be stolen when you are going to the office in the metro or you could lose it while running in the subway. The best thing to do with your money is to keep it in the bank or a liquid fund and use digital mode of payment as far as possible. Withdraw cash only when it is required. This also allows you to receive interest on your deposited funds. Not to mention, inflation is a huge problem and keeping your funds as cash will only reduce its value over a period. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Investing after being mansplained </h5>\r\n                    <p>It's not always your fault ladies, rather we get it. You will get a lot of men trying to explain to you about all kinds of financial products. They are not going to stop explaining until you believe that they know everything about it. This leads you to invest in the type of products which do not give the desired returns. Fortunately, there are certified financial experts to help you out and guide you in investing as per your financial goals. So, if you are in a doubt don't hesitate in connecting with a certified financial advisor. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button onClick={handleclose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MoneyLessons\r\n","import React, { useState } from 'react'\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction FinancialPlan() {\r\n\r\n    const [show, setShow] = useState(true)\r\n    const history = useHistory()\r\n    function handleclose() {\r\n        setShow(false)\r\n        history.goBack(\"/WomenSpecialHome\")\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n\r\n            <Modal\r\n                className=\"modalBackdrop\"\r\n                show={show}\r\n                onHide={handleclose}\r\n                size=\"lg\"\r\n            >\r\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\r\n                    <Modal.Title>Why you need a financial plan for a better future?</Modal.Title>\r\n                </Modal.Header>\r\n                <Modal.Body>\r\n                    <p>By Bhumika Khandelwal </p>\r\n                    <video className=\"w-100\" style={{ height: \"20rem\" }} src=\"Financial_plan.mp4\" controls />\r\n                    <h6>Warren Buffett said, “Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.” </h6>\r\n                    <p>Managing personal finance can be quite confusing. Having questions related to it is completely normal and one should be curious. Questions such as- </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>What is the current status of your investments and liabilities? </li>\r\n                        <li>What to do with the cash you have in the bank? Spend it or invest it? </li>\r\n                        <li>How much to allocate your savings on buying an asset or spending on a requirement? </li>\r\n                        <li>How to make your money earn for you? This is the one answer most of you have been looking for, right? </li>\r\n\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>So, other than being formal and allocating numbers which represent your earnings overall, financial planning answers the questions above. </p>\r\n                    <p>Now, whether you are working part- time or sipping coffee as an employee of some multinational company, you my friend require a financial plan in order to be happy and wealthy with your ESI (expenses, savings and investments.) </p>\r\n                    <h5>How exactly will a financial plan help? </h5>\r\n                    <p>Having a financial plan will simply help you understand and have control over your current earnings and expenses in order to keep you out of heavy debts, loans or overdraft or any unexpected financial difficulty in future.  </p>\r\n                    <p>Financial planning is especially important for people living on their pay-checks. A proper financial plan helps you to save from the existing earnings, find ways to manage expenses and make some investments. These investments create a corpus which you need when you plan for a career break, marriage, starting a family, kids education, travelling to your dream destination, buying a house or for your retirement.  </p>\r\n                    <p>But many might say that these things can just be done with some amount of savings and investments, so why should one must go and put their efforts into preparing some heavy plan about their financial situation!  </p>\r\n                    <p>Well, let’s explore what happens if they do make the effort for it. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Better budget allocation </h5>\r\n                    <p>Many times, you end up with absolutely no money at the end of the month right before the salary is about to be credited. Presence of a financial plan will help you list and understand all your general expenses and investments.  </p>\r\n                    <p>Once you know how much you are spending for a specific item, your monthly investment in SIPs, stocks etc and your monthly EMIs, you can work out ways to save some amount so as to avoid the situation you face at the end of every month and even might end up having more money to invest. </p>\r\n                    <h5>More savings than you expected </h5>\r\n                    <p>Now that your expenses are allocated properly and you have an appropriate amount of savings every month, you can invest more. Now, the thing about some of the investments in the market is they come with a lot of benefits and tax allowances. Good returns and less tax to be paid. Bingo!  </p>\r\n                    <h5>Be there for your family </h5>\r\n                    <p>Nowadays, everything has a price and if you want something no matter what, you have no choice but to pay the price. It is difficult, isn’t it? Thinking about all the future expenses and not being prepared for it, well say no more. With the help of your own financial plan, you will be ready with good savings for your future.  </p>\r\n                    <p>But are savings all which a good financial plan can help with? Well, no.

This way you are never out of funds and earning good returns at the same time. But be cautious and research well about the investments you are choosing. </p>\r\n                    <h5>Approach your goals fearlessly </h5>\r\n                    <p>Your financial plan makes you independent and courageous to finally pursue the things you wanted to without worrying about money. Whether it’s pursuing another degree, starting a new business or setting yourself up with social services. Move ahead with no pressure. You go, girl! </p>\r\n                    <h5>No tension about your pension </h5>\r\n                    <p>Well, this basically refers to the time when you are old and want to relax by your poolside at all times. Generally, when people are in their 20s and 30s they don’t think a lot about their ESI and always end up working or living off their pension money when they are in their 50s. But guess what?

The emergency came from nowhere and its impact was unknown. A lot of families got into financial trouble because they were not having financial resources available with them to tide through the pandemic which made their situation worse. A lot of such families would have suffered less had they planned their finances better and had an emergency fund to their rescue. </p>\r\n                    <h5>What is this emergency fund everybody talks about?</h5>\r\n                    <p>Emergency fund, as the name suggests, is an amount of sum available to you in the form of liquid assets which you can use in case of any kind of emergency be it career break, medical emergency, job loss, unplanned travel, special occasions or any other kind of emergency in the family.  </p>\r\n                    <h5>How can I create an emergency fund? </h5>\r\n                    <p>Now, when you know the importance of having an emergency fund, let's talk about how you can create this fund. Like any other financial goal for which you save and invest, you have to do it for the emergency fund as well. Your emergency fund could be created in many ways. It could be an SIP investment, fixed deposit, recurring deposit, liquid funds, savings account etc. </p>\r\n                    <p>It is always a good idea to keep your emergency fund in a liquid state. You never know when you need them. The best way is to divide the emergency fund amount between two or more asset classes. For example, if you have an emergency fund with Rs. 80,000 then divide it.</p>\r\n                    <p>Rs. 80,000 can be divided into: - </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Rs. 15,000-20,000 as cash. </li>\r\n                        <li>Rs. 20,000-25,000 in the savings account of your bank (so as to gain some interest on it) </li>\r\n                        <li>Rs 15,000-20,000 in fixed deposit in a bank (fetches higher interest rates than savings account). </li>\r\n                        <li>Rs. 15,000-20,000 in SIP investments (liquid funds which can give you better returns than a Fixed deposit). </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <h5>How much amount do I need to keep in my emergency fund? </h5>\r\n                    <p>Now, when you know the importance of an emergency fund and how to distribute the funds into various assets, there remains one important aspect of an emergency fund, what amount makes your emergency fund. This is a unique amount for everyone and it depends upon a lot many factors. However, generally it is advised to have an emergency fund equivalent to your six-month expenses. That’s the minimum you should have and you can always keep more funds depending upon factors like financial liabilities, medical liabilities, dependence on single earning members, uncertainty with your job or business etc.</p>\r\n                    <h5>Here is some important things to remember </h5>\r\n                    <p>As someone saving for future, there are things you should never forget which are: - </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>If you live off your paychecks, long-term funds are not for you. Not till you earn enough. </li>\r\n                        <li>Before you start saving, make your monthly expense plan. That's going to give you a better idea on how much more you can save. </li>\r\n                        <li>Buying something for your luxury does not count as an emergency.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Do not stop saving for anything else before covering your 6 months expense minimum. </li>\r\n                        <li>Save at least 20%-30% of your monthly income in order to reach your goals positively. </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>With a proper goal to save money, if anything else is required to succeed in creating your investment plan then it’s patience. Many times, you see something nice and want to purchase it without thinking twice. These are the desperate times where you need to stick to your plan and go ahead with what’s more important to you. </p>\r\n                    <p>So don't wait for any more panic situation to come your way before you start working on having an emergency fund.

Public share issuance allows a company to raise capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes share premiums for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Why and when a private company go for an IPO</h3>\r\n                    <p>Prior to an IPO, a company is a private. As a private company, the business grows with a relatively small number of shareholders including early investors like the founders, family, and friends along with professional investors such as venture capitalists or angel investors.</p>\r\n                    <p>When a company reaches a stage in its growth process where it believes it is mature enough for the rigors of SEBI regulations along with the benefits and responsibilities to public shareholders, it will begin to advertise its interest in going public.</p>\r\n                    <p>Typically, this stage of growth will occur when a company has reached a minimum valuation. However, private companies at various valuations with strong fundamentals and proven profitability potential can also qualify for an IPO, depending on the market competition and their ability to meet listing requirements.</p>\r\n                    <p>An IPO is a big step for a company as it provides the company with access to raising a lot of money. This gives the company a greater ability to grow and expand. The increased transparency and share listing credibility can also be a factor in helping it obtain better terms when seeking borrowed funds as well.</p>\r\n                    <p>IPO shares of a company are priced through underwriting due diligence. When a company goes public, the previously owned private share ownership converts to public ownership, and the existing private shareholders’ shares become worth the public trading price.</p>\r\n                    <p>Share underwriting can also include special provisions for private to public share ownership. Generally, the transition from private to public is a key time for private investors to cash in and earn the returns they were expecting. Private shareholders may hold onto their shares in the public market or sell a portion or all of them for gains.</p>\r\n                    <p>Meanwhile, the public market opens up a huge opportunity for millions of investors to buy shares in the company and contribute capital to a company’s shareholders' equity. The public consists of any individual or institutional investor who is interested in investing in the company.</p>\r\n                    <p>Overall, the number of shares the company sells and the price for which shares sell are the generating factors for the company’s new shareholders' equity value. Shareholders' equity still represents shares owned by investors when it is both private and public, but with an IPO the shareholders' equity increases significantly with cash from the primary issuance.</p>\r\n                    <h3> KEY TAKEAWAYS </h3>\r\n                    <p>An initial public offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance. </p>\r\n                    <p>Companies must meet requirements by exchanges and the SEBI to hold an initial public offering (IPO).</p>\r\n                    <p>IPOs provide companies with an opportunity to obtain capital by offering shares through the primary market.</p>\r\n                    <p>Companies hire investment banks to market, gauge demand, set the IPO price and date, and more.</p>\r\n                    <p>An IPO can be seen as an exit strategy for the company’s founders and early investors, realizing the full profit from their private investment. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h3>Types of IPO</h3>\r\n                    <p>There are two common types of IPO. They are:</p>\r\n                    <h3>Fixed Price Offering</h3>\r\n                    <p>Fixed Price IPO can be referred to as the issue price that some companies set for the initial sale of their shares. The investors come to know about the price of the stocks that the company decides to make public.</p>\r\n                    <p>The demand for the stocks in the market can be known once the issue is closed. If the investors partake in this IPO, they must ensure that they pay the full price of the shares when making the application.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Book Building Offering</h3>\r\n                    <p>In the case of book building, the company initiating an IPO offers a 20% price band on the stocks to the investors.

Many people try to save tax using wrong means by misinformation or hiding certain information. Honestly, there are various ways to save tax which are perfectly legal. This simply means that people can use these ways to save tax instead of using wrongful means and then getting caught and paying heavy penalties for such an offense later.  </p>\r\n                    <p>To start with, Income tax is a portion of your annual income which you pay to the government as per the income tax slab you fall into and the rate of tax defined by the government in its annual budget for that financial year. However, there are various ways and means which you can use which reduces your net taxable income. Here we are discussing some provisions which you can use to save tax. </p>\r\n                    <p>One of the easiest ways to reduce tax is to invest in tax saving instruments. You can easily find a lot of investment opportunities listed under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. 80C allows deduction upto Rs. 1.5 lakh for the investment made in Public Provident Fund, Employee Provident Fund, LIC premium, Equity-linked Saving Scheme (ELSS), Annual principal amount payment towards home loan, Stamp duty and registration charges for purchase of property, Sukanya Smriddhi yojana (SSY), National saving certificate (NSC), Senior citizen savings scheme (SCSS), ULIP, tax saving FD for 5 years, Infrastructure bonds, Children Tuition fee etc.  </p>\r\n                    <p>Other than provisions under section 80C, one can avail tax benefits under following provisions as applicable:  </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Section 24: Tax deduction on interest on home loan:  Interest deduction for housing loan upto Rs 2 lakh is available to you under Section 24 if the house property is self-occupied or vacant whereas if the house is rented, the entire interest amount can be deducted from the ‘Income from house property.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Section 80 D: No pressure while paying your hospital bills- Medical treatments are pretty expensive these days. This is why one should get medical insurance. Individuals can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 25000 for medical insurance premium for self, spouse and dependent children.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Section 80TTA: Depositing money on your savings account benefits you with interest. For taxation purpose, there is an exception upto Rs. 10,000 on the annual interest earned through your savings account.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Section 80G: You can avail tax deduction on donations you gave to charitable institutions.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Don't worry while selling your equity- The tax rule for equity is maintained at 10% tax if the amount of long-term capital gain exceeds Rs. 1 lakh. So there is no tax liability if your gain is less than Rs 1 lakh.</li>\r\n                        <li>Section 80 E: An education loan helps you not only finance your foreign studies but it can save you a lot of tax as well. If you have taken an education loan and are repaying the same, then the interest paid on that education loan is allowed as a deduction from the total income under Section 80E.  </li>\r\n                        <li>Section 80 EEB - Now buying an electric car comes with a lot of tax benefits for you apart from the environmental benefits. A deduction for interest payments up to Rs 1,50,000 on purchase of an electric vehicle is available under Section 80 EEB to an individual taxpayer for personal use or for business use. So, it's time to go electric now. </li>\r\n                        <li>In case you have an extra income - if you have a way to earn any secondary income (which is not the part of your primary income) there is a tax benefit for you too. You can open a separate HUF account for your secondary income like rent from an ancestral property. </li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>Use various provisions discussed above to manage your tax liabilities effectively and invest the money saved to grow your wealth. </p>\r\n\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button onClick={handleclose}>\r\n                        Close\r\n                    </Button>\r\n                </Modal.Footer>\r\n            </Modal>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tax\r\n","import React, { useState } from 'react'\r\nimport { Modal, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\r\nimport { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nfunction WomenLoans() {\r\n\r\n    const [show, setShow] = useState(true)\r\n    const history = useHistory()\r\n    function handleclose() {\r\n        setShow(false)\r\n        history.goBack(\"/WomenSpecialHome\")\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n\r\n            <Modal\r\n                className=\"modalBackdrop\"\r\n                show={show}\r\n                onHide={handleclose}\r\n                size=\"lg\"\r\n            >\r\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\r\n                    <Modal.Title>Benefits of women taking home loans over men </Modal.Title>\r\n                </Modal.Header>\r\n                <Modal.Body>\r\n                    <p>By Bhumika Khandelwal </p>\r\n                    <video className=\"w-100\" src=\"Benefits_women_taking_home_loans.mp4\" controls />\r\n                    <p>Many of us still dream of having our own space, something to call our home, somewhere to enjoy our time peacefully. A survey in 2019 found out that just 50% of the people are able to get themselves a place of their own, while others are still counting on renting a place for living. In the other 50% of the people, you will be surprised to know that most of these percentages contain women around the nation.  </p>\r\n                    <p>That’s right! Many of the women find themselves incapable of buying a house but what if they find out that there’s a way? What if buying a home for a woman is easier than society thinks it is? Well, they say, \"when there is a will, there’s a way.\" </p>\r\n                    <p>Bank bazaar reported that under a year the number of home loans taken by women increased by 7.41%. This easily proves that women are giving more priority to having a space in recent years. Things have changed and soon more good results will come to light. </p>\r\n                    <p>Let’s find out what are some of the benefits that are there for women if they buy a home: </p>\r\n                    <h5>1.\tLower interest rate on home loan </h5>\r\n                    <p>Women in comparison to men get home loans at lower rates. For instance, when there is a male borrower, he is entitled to pay an interest of say 6.75% p.a, at the same case if a woman acts as the primary or co borrower then she will be granted the loan with the interest rate reduced by 0.05 to 0.1. This also leads to less EMI instalments every month and overall reduction in the cost of the home for the buyer.  </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>2.\tExtension in tenure period </h5>\r\n                    <p>A male borrower is allowed to take up a home loan for 20 years or the age of 65, whichever comes earlier but a female borrower can repay the loan in 30 years or before the age of 75, whichever is earlier. Even when a woman is included as a co- borrower and joint holder of a property, the tenure for that loan will be extended depending on the age of the woman. For instance, the primary borrower is a man who is 40 years old this means he will get a tenure of 20 years to pay the loan, now his wife comes into the picture who is 35 years old and now the tenure is simply increased to 30 years giving them extra time to complete the contract.  </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>3.  Better chances of loan sanction </h5>\r\n                    <p>Women are always seen as someone very careful about things. The one who remembers to pay their bills in time and also save for their needs. This is not just said but observed through various reports. So, if there is a woman who is borrowing money to build her house or is made a co- applicant, the chances of the loan being approved may increase.  </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>4.\tPMAY scheme brings great benefits for women </h5>\r\n                    <p>PMAY scheme of government of India offer interest subsidy upto Rs 2.67 lakh on home loans but co-ownership is mandatory for availing this benefit. Also, under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low-Income Group (LIG) segments of the PMAY scheme, preference is extended to widows as well as single women.  </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h5>Conclusion </h5>\r\n                    <p>A home loan is approved after checking all the factors and necessary points. As a woman there are many benefits and one should use that benefit to finally achieve what they want. Not to forget, a woman plays a lot of roles in her life including a homemaker, a mother, a wife, a daughter, a struggler and an achiever. We hope each of them gets what they truly dream of.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                </Modal.Body>\r\n                <Modal.Footer>\r\n                    <Button onClick={handleclose}>\r\n

The bounce charges\r\n                range from Rs.600 to Rs. 1,200, and penal interest is charged at\r\n                the rate of 2% to 4% per month on the monthly instalment/EMI\r\n                outstanding, from the date of default until the receipt of\r\n                monthly instalment/ EMI.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5\">\r\n                Part-prepayments help make loan repayment cheaper as they reduce\r\n                the outstanding principal. However, make sure to judge the\r\n                benefit of a partprepayment by accounting for the fee of 2% plus\r\n                taxes on the amount paid. The part-prepayment fee does not apply\r\n                to the Flexi loan facility.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5\">\r\n                If you want to pre-close your loan, you will incur a nominal\r\n                charge of 4% plus taxes on the outstanding principal. For a\r\n                Flexi loan, the foreclosure charge is 4% plus taxes and cess on\r\n                the withdrawable amount.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5\">\r\n                To view your loan documents and statements, simply visit the\r\n                customer portal - Experia.

You get a pre-approved loan limit based on your credit profile and can use it to meet your funding needs on the go. You can withdraw funds from this limit whenever you need finance and can prepay them whenever you have surplus money in hand. You pay interest only on what you withdraw from your loan limit and not on the entire sanction. This way you can address your ever-evolving needs on a case-to-case basis. Interest is charged at the end of the day and you can use the Flexi Day-Wise Interest Calculator to use the loan optimally.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 \">\r\n                We do not charge anything extra for each withdrawal and part-prepayment you make. So, you can foreclose your loan ahead of schedule to save on your interest outgo. Similarly, we do not ask for additional paperwork for withdrawals and part-prepayments. You can simply transact online, and borrow and deposit funds, through our customer portal - Experia.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 \">\r\n                Our Flexi personal loans are available for salaried individuals, self-employed individuals, professionals, and businessmen.

You can pay the principal later. This reduces your instalments by up to 45%.* Interest-only EMIs can help you ease your way into repayment and accommodate EMIS into a tight budget.

You get a pre-approved loan limit based on your credit profile and can use it to meet your funding needs on the go. You can withdraw funds from this limit whenever you need finance and can prepay them whenever you have surplus money in hand. You pay interest only on what you withdraw from your loan limit and not on the entire sanction. This way you can address your ever-evolving needs on a case-to-case basis.

You get a pre-approved loan limit based on your credit profile and can use it to meet your funding needs on the go. You can withdraw funds from this limit whenever you need finance and can prepay them whenever you have surplus money in hand. You pay interest only on what you withdraw from your loan limit and not on the entire sanction. This way you can address your ever-evolving needs on a case-to-case basis. Interest is charged at the end of the day and you can use the Flexi Day-Wise Interest Calculator to use the loan optimally.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 \">\r\n                We do not charge anything extra for each withdrawal and part-prepayment you make. So, you can foreclose your loan ahead of schedule to save on your interest outgo. Similarly, we do not ask for additional paperwork for withdrawals and part-prepayments. You can simply transact online, and borrow and deposit funds, through our customer portal - Experia.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 \">\r\n                Our Flexi personal loans are available for salaried individuals, self-employed individuals, professionals, and businessmen.

You can pay the principal later. This reduces your instalments by up to 45%.* Interest-only EMIs can help you ease your way into repayment and accommodate EMIS into a tight budget. You can also spread out repayment over 84 months** and make the loan even more affordable.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 \">\r\n                Flexi Personal Loans are ideal for situations where the expenses are ad-hoc in nature, such as home renovation, a wedding, or travel or when you aren't sure of your funding needs.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className=\"tw-m-4 tw-mb-10 tw-ml-5 \">* Conditions apply <br/>**Applicable for Flexi Hybrid loans</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default FeaturesFHLMob;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ScrollUpButton from \"react-scroll-up-button\";\r\nimport Steps from \"./Components/Steps/Steps\";\r\nimport Faq from \"./Components/FAQ/Faq\";\r\nimport AboutFHL from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/AboutFHL/AboutFHL\";\r\nimport FeaturesFHL from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/FeaturesFHL/FeaturesFHL\";\r\nimport InterestFHL from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/InterestFHL/InterestFHL\";\r\nimport DocumentFHL from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/DocumentFHL/DocumentFHL\";\r\nimport RequirementFHL from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/RequirementFHL/RequirementFHL\";\r\nimport FeaturesFHLMob from \"./Components/FlexiHybrid/FeaturesFHL/FeaturesFHLMob\";\r\n\r\nconst Bajaj_FHL = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <AboutFHL />\r\n            <FeaturesFHL />\r\n            <FeaturesFHLMob />\r\n            <InterestFHL />\r\n            <DocumentFHL />\r\n            <RequirementFHL />\r\n            <Steps />\r\n            <Faq />\r\n            <ScrollUpButton/>\r\n        </>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Bajaj_FHL;\r\n","import { Tab } from '@headlessui/react'\r\nimport classNames from \"classnames\";\r\n\r\n//components\r\nimport Bajaj_TL from '../../Bajaj_TL';\r\nimport Bajaj_FL from '../../Bajaj_FL';\r\nimport Bajaj_FHL from '../../Bajaj_FHL';\r\n\r\nexport default function Tabs() {\r\n  return (\r\n\r\n\r\n    <Tab.Group>\r\n      <div className=\"tw-w-full tw-max-w-md tw-mx-auto tw-px-4 tw-py-16 tw-pb-20 sm:tw-px-0\">\r\n\r\n        <Tab.List className=\"tw-flex tw-p-1 tw-space-x-1 tw-bg-nishblue-400 tw-rounded-xl\">\r\n          <Tab\r\n            className={({ selected }) =>\r\n              classNames(\r\n                'tw-w-full tw-py-2.5 tw-text-sm tw-leading-5 tw-font-medium tw-rounded-lg tw-border-solid tw-border-l-2 tw-border-r-2',\r\n                'tw-focus:outline-none tw-focus:ring-2 tw-ring-offset-2 tw-ring-offset-nishblue-400 tw-ring-white tw-ring-opacity-60',\r\n                selected\r\n                  ?
