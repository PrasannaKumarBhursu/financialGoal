                Flexi loans by Bajaj Finserv are the new way of borrowing funds in India. You get a pre-approved loan limit based on your credit profile and can use it to meet your funding needs on the go. You can withdraw funds from this limit whenever you need finance and can prepay them whenever you have surplus money in hand. You pay interest only on what you withdraw from your loan limit and not on the entire sanction. This way you can address your ever-evolving needs on a case-to-case basis. Interest is charged at the end of the day and you can use the Flexi Day-Wise Interest Calculator to use the loan optimally.
              </p>
              <p className="tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 ">
                We do not charge anything extra for each withdrawal and part-prepayment you make. So, you can foreclose your loan ahead of schedule to save on your interest outgo. Similarly, we do not ask for additional paperwork for withdrawals and part-prepayments. You can simply transact online, and borrow and deposit funds, through our customer portal - Experia.
              </p>
              <p className="tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 ">
                Our Flexi personal loans are available for salaried individuals, self-employed individuals, professionals, and businessmen. We have simple eligibility criteria and require a basic set of documents to approve of your loan.
              </p>
              <p className="tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 ">
                A unique Flexi loan feature is that you can choose to pay just the interest component of your EMI for the initial part of the tenor. You can pay the principal later. This reduces your instalments by up to 45%.* Interest-only EMIs can help you ease your way into repayment and accommodate EMIS into a tight budget. You can also spread out repayment over 84 months** and make the loan even more affordable.
              </p>
              <p className="tw-m-4 tw-ml-5 ">
                Flexi Personal Loans are ideal for situations where the expenses are ad-hoc in nature, such as home renovation, a wedding, or travel or when you aren't sure of your funding needs.
